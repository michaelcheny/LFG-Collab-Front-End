# LFG Collab

LFG Collab is built using React, Redux, and Ruby on Rails as an API for the back end. This is an online project hub for users to post their projects and to get others to help collaborate on them. Projects can range anywhere from group fitness, to online pair programming, to open-source money management apps. Users can join the projects they like, leave comments, and give feedback.

This app is dependent on back end directory to be run in conjunction: https://github.com/michaelcheny/react-redux-project-backend.

# Credits

Inspirations came from browsing open-source projects through out the web. I wanted to create a main hub for users to post projects instead of having to visit multiple sites.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
